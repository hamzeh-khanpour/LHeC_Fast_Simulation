Photon-photon processes in electron-ion collisions
Asked by Michael Pitt on 2022-11-23
Dear experts,

I'm interested in looking at photon-induced processes in electron-ion collisions (where both electron and ion emit a photon)
Can it be simulated, and if yes, what are the right options for the beam type?

I used
     3 = lpp1 ! beam 1 type
     2 = lpp2 ! beam 2 type
     18.0 = ebeam1 ! beam 1 total energy in GeV
     275.0 = ebeam2 ! beam 2 total energy in GeV

gamma fusion at e+e-
Asked by Roberto Franceschini on 2020-03-06
I am succesfully generating non-zero cross-sections for a a > f f~ at e+ e- colliders through

     3 = lpp1 ! beam 1 type
     3 = lpp2 ! beam 2 type

However if I try a resonant production a a > resonance the cross-section is always zero.

The resonance is very light compared to the CoM energy, so the only thing I can imagine is the particle being too narrow, but I would have said with the sintax 2>1 above the width should not even be called in the calculation.

1) A massive s-channel particle has a width set to zero. (it is light enough)
   2) The pdf are zero for at least one of the initial state particles
      or you are using maxjetflavor=4 for initial state b:s. (unclear if this applies for 3 = lpp1)
   3) The cuts are too strong. (no cuts on the resonance)
   Please check/correct your param_card and/or your run_card.

Am I asking something MG is not supposed to compute?

Options 1 & 2 in run_card collider type
Asked by J SANZ on 2015-01-14
I am generating the subprocess a a > w+ w- in the SM with Madgraph5.
In principle, in the run_card.dat I have chosen the collider type option 2 for both beams:
         2 = lpp1 ! beam 1 type
         2 = lpp2 ! beam 2 type ,
which is said to correspond to "photon from proton".
Looking at the manual (https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/madgraph/attachment/wiki/ManualAndHelp/Manual-March-2007.pdf), option 2 correspond to "the improved Weizsaecker-Williams formula [12]".
I have done
     import sm
     generate a a > w+ w-
     launch
and it has worked ok.

However, my question has to do with the fact that if I choose the collider type option 1 for both beams (protons):
         1 = lpp1 ! beam 1 type
         1 = lpp2 ! beam 2 type ,
it runs without complaining (!?) and yields a total cross section somewhat higher for the same subprocess a a > w+ w-.
So I guess that somehow it takes into account the PDF for photons in the pronton (option 1), but I am not really sure what MadGraph is doing when I choose this last option 1,1 .
What is it exactly computing?

A final remark is that if I make "generate w+ w- > w+ w-" and choose the collider type option 1 in the run_card then it does not work and MadGraph complains. So only the photon is really implemented (somehow) in the proton in the collider type option 1.
