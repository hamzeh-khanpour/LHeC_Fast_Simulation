# LHeC Fast Simulation

This repository provides simulation tools and analysis scripts for studying anomalous quartic gauge couplings (AQGCs) in electron-proton collisions at the Large Hadron-Electron Collider (LHeC). The project focuses on simulating and analyzing key processes that probe the dynamics of $\gamma\gamma \to W^+ W^-$ interactions.

## Key Features

### Anomalous Quartic Gauge Couplings
The study of anomalous quartic gauge couplings (AQGCs) is essential for exploring deviations from Standard Model predictions. AQGCs arise from higher-dimensional operators and provide insights into new physics at high-energy scales.

### Simulated Processes
The following processes are central to this project:
1. **$\gamma\gamma \to W^+ W^-$**
   - Simulated to analyze photon-induced interactions in the LHeC environment.
2. **$e^- p \to e^- W^+ W^- p$**
   - A key electroweak process in electron-proton collisions, where the scattered electron and proton remain in the final state.

---

## Objectives
- Simulate high-energy $\gamma\gamma$ and $e^- p$ collisions at the LHeC.
- Analyze AQGC sensitivity through the processes $\gamma\gamma \to W^+ W^-$ and $e^- p \to e^- W^+ W^- p$.
- Provide tools for differential cross-section analysis, rapidity distributions, and invariant mass studies of the final-state particles.

---

## Repository Contents
- **Scripts and Tools**: Python scripts and analysis tools for parsing LHE files, generating histograms, and visualizing distributions.
- **Simulations**: Includes configurations for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO to simulate relevant processes.
- **Plots and Results**: Sample plots for $P_T$, $\eta$, rapidity, and invariant mass distributions.

# üìä Anomalous Quartic Gauge Couplings (aQGC) Sensitivity at the LHeC

This repository contains a full pipeline for estimating the sensitivity of the LHeC to the anomalous quartic gauge coupling parameter $f_{M2}/\Lambda^4$ via shape-based profile likelihood scans. The analysis is based on semi-leptonic $W^+W^-$ production from $\gamma\gamma$ fusion, including realistic event simulation, machine learning-based signal-background discrimination, and statistical limit setting.

## üß† ML Pipeline

### 1. Data Preparation

Run:

```bash
python3 ExtractData_Train_PlotROC.py
```

- Extracts samples from histogram templates in `output_histograms.root`
- Samples kinematic variables from:
  - Leptons
  - Jets
  - MET
- Saves as `ml_input_from_histograms.csv` with `label`, `weight`, and `process`.

### 2. Training the BDT Classifier

Run:

```bash
python3 train_xgboost_and_plot_roc.py
```

- Trains XGBoost BDT
- Computes AUC & ROC curve
- Appends `bdt_score` and `process` columns
- Saves as `ml_with_bdt_scores.csv`

---

## üìê Profile Likelihood Limit Setting

Run:

```bash
python3 limit_scan_fm2_profile_likelihood_v5.py
```

### Features:

- Calculates optimal BDT cut based on AMS.
- Computes:
  - ML efficiency
  - Preselection efficiency
  - Total efficiency = ML √ó Preselection
- Constructs Asimov dataset (background only).
- Defines likelihood:

  $$
  \mathcal{L}(f_{M2}) = \prod_{i=1}^{N_{\text{bins}}} \text{Poisson}(n_i^{\text{obs}} \mid s_i(f_{M2}) + b_i)
  $$

- Scans $f_{M2}/\Lambda^4$ and finds 95% CL exclusion:

  $$
  q(f_{M2}) = -2 \log \frac{\mathcal{L}(f_{M2})}{\mathcal{L}(0)} > 3.84
  $$

## üìä Output

- `profile_likelihood_fm2_plot.pdf` showing $q(f_{M2})$
- 95% CL bounds printed in console:

```
