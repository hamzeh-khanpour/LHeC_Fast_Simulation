# LHeC Fast Simulation

This repository provides simulation tools and analysis scripts for studying anomalous quartic gauge couplings (AQGCs) in electron-proton collisions at the Large Hadron-Electron Collider (LHeC). The project focuses on simulating and analyzing key processes that probe the dynamics of $\gamma\gamma \to W^+ W^-$ interactions.

## Key Features

### Anomalous Quartic Gauge Couplings
The study of anomalous quartic gauge couplings (AQGCs) is essential for exploring deviations from Standard Model predictions. AQGCs arise from higher-dimensional operators and provide insights into new physics at high-energy scales.

### Simulated Processes
The following processes are central to this project:
1. **$\gamma\gamma \to W^+ W^-$**
   - Simulated to analyze photon-induced interactions in the LHeC environment.
2. **$e^- p \to e^- W^+ W^- p$**
   - A key electroweak process in electron-proton collisions, where the scattered electron and proton remain in the final state.

## Objectives
- Simulate high-energy $\gamma\gamma$ and $e^- p$ collisions at the LHeC.
- Analyze AQGC sensitivity through the processes $\gamma\gamma \to W^+ W^-$ and $e^- p \to e^- W^+ W^- p$.
- Provide tools for differential cross-section analysis, rapidity distributions, and invariant mass studies of the final-state particles.
